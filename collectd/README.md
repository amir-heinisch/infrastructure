# [Collectd](https://collectd.org/)

> collectd is a daemon which collects system and application performance metrics periodically and provides mechanisms to store the values in a variety of ways, for example in RRD files.

- This tool should be quite fast because its written in C and it also has lots of plugins ready to use

Ansible variables:

- collectd\_interval:	collection interval
- collectd\_plugins:	plugins to use
